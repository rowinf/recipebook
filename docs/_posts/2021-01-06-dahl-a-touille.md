- 2 tablespoons honey or date puree
- 400g (12oz) can tomatoes chopped
- 1 small green capsicum (bell pepper)
- 1 cup frozen peas

### Directions
1. Cook lentils and boiling water in their own pot for around 12 minutes or until soft.
2. In a large pot or frying pan, sautÃ© the onion, oil, garlic, ginger, celery, eggplant, and mushrooms until they are soft.
3. Combine all the other ingredients, stir and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for around 5 minutes to let the flavours mingle.
