title: Chopped salad with shallot vinaigrette feta and dill
---

### Ingredients
* 1 medium shallot, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* Kosher salt
* 8 ounces sugar snap peas (about 2 cups), trimmed, thinly sliced on a diagonal into 1/2-inch pieces
* 1 bunch radishes (about 12), trimmed, thinly sliced
* 4 medium Persian cucumbers, quartered lengthwise, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
* 1 romaine heart, quartered lengthwise, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
* 1/2 medium head of radicchio, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
* 6 ounces feta, crumbled (about 1 1/2 cups)
* 1 1/2 cups torn dill fronds
* Freshly ground black pepper

### Directions
 1. Mix shallot, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vinegar in a large bowl. Let sit 10 minutes, then mix in oil. Set vinaigrette aside.
 2. Meanwhile, mix a palmful of salt into a medium bowl of ice water; add peas. Let sit 10 minutes, then drain and pat dry (this makes them super crisp).
 3. Add peas, radishes, cucumbers, romaine, and radicchio to bowl with reserved vinaigrette; toss well to coat. Add feta and dill, season with salt and pepper, and toss again to combine. Transfer to a platter to serve.
