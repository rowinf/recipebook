### Ingredients
- 1 ounce dried mushrooms
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium-size yellow onion, chopped
- 1 large carrot, chopped
- 1 celery rib, chopped
- 1 cup pearl barley
- 8 ounces white mushrooms, sliced
- 6 cups vegetable stock (see A Note About Stock)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives

### Steps

1. Place the dried mushrooms in a heatproof measuring cup and cover with hot water. Let sit until softened. Drain, straining and reserving 1/2 cup of the soaking liquid, thinly slice the mushrooms, and set aside. 
2. Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, and celery, cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. 
3. Transfer the cooked vegetables to a 4- to 6-quart slow cooker. Add the barley, both kinds of mushrooms, the stock, the reserved mush-room liquid, and thyme and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook on Low for 6 hours. Taste to adjust the seasonings before serving. If a thinner soup is desired, add more stock. 
4. Serve garnished with the chives.
