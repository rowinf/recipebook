title: Braised chicken and parsnips
---

Braise chicken in tangy cider viegar with parsnips and sage for a dish you'll crave all fall and winter. We serve this over brown rice, but bread would also be great for soaking up the sauce.

## Ingredients
- 1kg chicken thighs
- coarse salt and pepper
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 leeks (white and light green parts only) thinly sliced and rinsed well
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 pound parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 10 fresh sage leaves
- 1 3/4 cups low sodium chicken broth

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Season chicken with salt and pepper.
3. in a medium dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high. Working in batches, add chicken skin-side down and cook until browned 8-10 minutes; transfer to a plate
4. Reduce heat to medium. Add leeks and cook until tender, about 4 minutes.
5. Add vinegar and scrape up brown bits with a wooden spoon. Add parsnips, sage, broth, and chicken (with its juices), and bring to a boil.
6. Cover and transfer to oven. Cook until parsnips are very tender and chicken is cooked through, about 50 minutes.
