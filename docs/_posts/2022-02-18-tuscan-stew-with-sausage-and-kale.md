---

## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 500g pork or chicken sausage
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 3/4 tsp fresh ground pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 1 carrot, diced
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 can (425g) diced tomatoes

- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 bunch kale, ribs removed, chopped

## Directions
1. Heat a large Dutch oven or pot over medium high heat.
2. Add the olive oil. When hot, add the sausage and cook for 7-8 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break up the sausage as it cooks. Add the onion, salt, pepper, garlic, celery, and carrot and cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes. Lower the heat to medium
3. Add the tomato paste a spoonful at a time, pressing it against the sides of the pot as you stir to eliminate lumps.
4. Stir in the diced tomatoes, chicken broth, basil, and thyme. Cover and let cook for about 10 minutes.
5. Toss in the kale and continue cooking for another 10 minutes. Service immediately or keep at a low simmer until ready to ladle into bowls.
