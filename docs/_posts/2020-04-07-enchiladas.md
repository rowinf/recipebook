### Ingredients
- 1 cup salsa
- 12 (8") corn tortillas
- 3 cups grated Monterey jack cheese
- 2 cups red or green chilli sauce
- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
- 3 cups cooked shredded beef or refried beans
### Sauce
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1/4 cup chili powder
- 8 oz tomato sauce (or half a tube of tomato past + 1/2 cup water)
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1/4 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp onion salt
- salt to taste

### Sauce
1. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in flour and chili powder, reduce heat to medium, and cook until lightly brown, stirring constantly to prevent burning flour. 
2. Gradually stir in tomato sauce, water, cumin, garlic powder, and onion salt into the flour and chili powder until smooth, and continue cooking over medium heat approximately 10 minutes, or until thickened slightly. Season to taste with salt.
### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375F (190C)
2. Ladle 1/2 cup of the salsa into a 9" x 12" baking pan
3. Put 1/4 cup of the beef or beans in the centre of each tortilla. Add 2 tablespoons shredded cheese. Roll up and place in baking pan.
4. When all the enchiladas are in the baking pan, cover with the remaining sauce and cheese. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Remove from the oven and garnish with cilantro.
