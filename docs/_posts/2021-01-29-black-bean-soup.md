### Ingredients

1 lb. Dried Black Beans
4 c. Low Sodium Chicken Broth
2 c. Water
3 cloves Garlic, Minced
1 whole Medium Onion, Diced
1 whole Red Bell Pepper, Seeded And Diced
1 whole Green Bell Pepper, Seeded And Diced
1 whole Yellow Bell Pepper, Seeded And Diced
1 tsp. Kosher Salt (more To Taste)
1 1/2 tsp. Chili Powder
1 1/2 tsp. Cumin

### FIXINS
Sour Cream
Avocado, diced
Cilantro Leaves
Lime Wedges
Corn Tortillas Cut Into Strips

### Directions
1. Place the beans in a bowl or pot, cover with cold water, and allow to soak overnight *OR* add beans to a medium pot and cover with hot water. Bring to a boil, then boil for 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the pot and allow the beans to sit for 1 hour. Drain the beans and rinse them with cold water.
2. In a medium pot, add beans, chicken stock, water, onions, and bell peppers. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. At that time, add salt, chili powder, and cumin and stir. Cover and continue simmering for another 30 minutes to 1 hour, until the liquid level is to your liking (anywhere from very thick to a thinner soup is fine!)
3. Taste for seasoning and add more of what it needs. Serve soup in a bowl with sour cream, extra diced bell pepper, avocado, cilantro, tortilla strips, and a lime wedge.
