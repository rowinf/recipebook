---

### Ingredients
- 1/2 lb bacon, chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 bunch green onion, chopped
- 1/2 head cabbage, coarsely chopped
- 2 potatoes, peeled and diced
- 5 cups chicken broth
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried fine herbs
- salt & freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
- 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 teaspoon dried dill
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

### Directions
1. Sauté bacon in a dutch oven over medium heat, until partially crisp. Pour off all but 3 to 4 TBS of the fat.
2. Add the chopped onions and cabbage to the pan. Sauté for 5 minutes, or until onions are soft.
3. Stir in potatoes, then chicken broth, fine herbs and salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Immediately reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until potatoes are quite tender.
4. Just before serving add the cheeses slowly, stirring until melted, but do not allow to boil. Add remaining ingredients and adjust seasoning if required.
