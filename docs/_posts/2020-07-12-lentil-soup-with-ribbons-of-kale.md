title: Lentil soup with ribbons of kale
---

### Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 1 celery rib, chopped
- 1 large carrot, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 1/4 cups dried brown lentils, picked over and rinsed
- 6 cups vegetable stock (see A Note About Stock) or water
- 1 tablespoon tamari or other soy sauce
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 or 5 large kale leaves, tough stems removed

### Directions
1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and garlic, cover, and cook until softened, 8 to 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the cooked vegetables to a 4- to 6-quart slow cooker, add the lentils, stock, and tamari; cover, and cook on Low for 8 hours. Sea-son with salt and pepper.
3. Meanwhile, or beforehand, tightly roll the kale leaves up like a cigar and cut them crosswise into thin ribbons. Cook the kale in a pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 5 minutes, and add to the soup when ready to serve.
