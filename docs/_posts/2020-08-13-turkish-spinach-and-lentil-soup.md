---

### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cup lentils, uncooked
- 5 cups nonfat beef broth
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 cups onions, chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 2 bay leaves
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 cans diced tomatoes in juice
- 1 pinch dried rosemary
- salt and pepper
- 2 cups spinach, coarsely chopped
- to taste parsley, chopped 

### Directions
1. Rinse the lentils.
2. Bring them to a boil in the beef broth.
3. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 40 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a heavy soup pot. Saute the onions until translucent. Add the garlic, cayeene, bay leaves and bulgur.
5. Stir the mixture on medium heat until the onions and bulgur are lightly browned.
6. Mix in the parsley and tomatoes.
7. When the tomatoes begin to give up their juice, gently stir in the tomato paste. Pour the lentils and their liquid into the soup pot with the onions and bulgur.
8. Simmer the soup for 15 minutes.
9. Add the rosemary, salt and pepper to taste. If the lentils and bulgur have absorbed too much liquid, add more broth, water or tomato juice. Remove the bay leaves.
10. Just before serving, stir in the fresh spinach and let it wilt in the hot soup.
    Garnish with more fresh parsley. 
11. NOTES: Serve this soup with crusty bread. Broil the bread on both sides, rubbed with a cut garlic clove, and drizzled with olive oil.
