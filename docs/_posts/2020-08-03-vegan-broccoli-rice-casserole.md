title: Vegan Broccoli Rice Casserole
---

### Ingredients
- 3 1/4 cup / 780 ml unsweetened vegan milk of choice
- 4 cups / 960 ml flavourful broth/stock
- 2 cups / 400 g uncooked white long grain rice * see notes for alternatives
- 1/3 cup / 42 g all purpose flour , (plain flour in the UK). For GF use an all purpose GF flour.
- 1/2 cup / 56 g nutritional yeast
- 4 cloves garlic , very finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon fine salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 / 184 g Field Roast Italian Sausages ** see notes for alternatives
- 2 large heads fresh broccoli ***
- 1 cup / 112 g vegan cheese shreds ****
- 2 tablespoons vegan butter ***** optional 

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375 Â°F (180 c) and have a 3 quart / 2.8 L ceramic or glass ovenproof dish (roughly 9x13x2inch) ready.
2. Wash and cut the broccoli up into florets. You can leave quite a long stalky bit on each one to save wasting it.
3. Combine the vegan milk and stock in a pan and warm over a medium heat on the stove top until very hot, almost about to boil.
4. Meanwhile, add the rice, flour, nutritional yeast, garlic, salt and pepper to the oven proof dish. Stir together to combine.
5. Slice the sausages into thin rounds and scatter them across the top of the rice mixture.
6. Once the liquid is hot, pour it over the top of the rice and sausage mixture.
7. Cover the entire top in broccoli florets. Plant them stalk down in the rice-y liquid. Then if you are using the butter, dot little blobs all over. Doesn't matter where.
8. Put in the oven uncovered and bake for 50 - 55 minutes. Use a spoon to dig under the broccoli and taste a piece of rice. It should be soft, or almost cooked, with just a little bit of bite. If it's at that stage continue to the next step. If it's still hard, cover the dish with tin foil or a lid and place back in the oven for another 10 minutes. Then continue.
9. Stir it well so the broccoli becomes mixed up through the rice, then sprinkle over the vegan cheese. Cover with tin foil and return to the oven for 10 minutes so the cheese can melt and the rice can continue cooking just a little bit more.
10. Remove from the oven, remove the foil and serve up immediately.
