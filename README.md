# Recipe book

[view site](https://rowinf.github.io/recipebook/)

Converts some Markdown files I wrote in IA Writer into a jekyll page so I can reference anywhere when I'm thinking about when to cook and I can share if needed.

I've included the source for each recipe, each came from a great resource.

`$ rake` will rebuild the recipes from the IA Writer source
