title: Feijoa Crumble Muffin Recipe
---
### Ingredients
- 1 1/3 cup standard flour
- 2/3 cup wholemeal flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 150 ml dairy free milk (rice, oat or soy work well)
- 1/3 cup oil
- 2/3 cup applesauce
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 300g feijoa's scooped out of shells & rough chopped

### Crumble top
- 1/2 cup standard flour
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 3 Tbsp dairy free spread
- 1/4 cup rolled oats

### Method
1. Preheat oven to 175 C
2. Spray muffin pans with oil spray to prevent sticking.
3. Sift flours, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together three times. This ensures a really light muffin. Add chopped feijoa's and mix through the flour mix.
4. Whisk brown sugar with the oil until lump free in a separate bowl.
5. Next whisk in the applesauce, then vanilla and milk.
6. Carefully fold the wet ingredients into the dry. Do not over mix. The mixture should be lumpy not smooth and few bits of flour may remain.
7. Fill your muffin pans to the tops for a generous size muffin.
8. Make the crumble top. Sift flour, baking powder and cinnamon into a bowl.
9. Rub in the spread with your fingers. Add sugar and oats.
10. Divide crumble mix evenly between pans.
11. Bake for 25 -30 minutes until golden & cooked all the way through.
