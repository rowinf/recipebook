The course crystals of turbinado sugar give these delicate muffins an appealing crunch.

### Ingredients
- 2 cups flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups fresh blueberries

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 180C. lightly spray 12 muffin cups with cooking oil spray. Combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, mix the egg, butter, milk and vanilla extract.
3. Stir to combine well. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Do not overmix. 
4. Gently fold in the blueberries. Fill the muffin cups two-thirds full. Sprinkle each muffin with the turbinado sugar. Bake for 35 minutes, or until muffin tops are golden-brown and a toothpick inserted into the centre of a muffin comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes in the muffin tins, then untold and transfer to a cooling rack. Serve warm. Freeze leftover muffins in plastic wrap or in a tightly sealed plastic bag for up to 2 months.
